Getting Ssscrape
================

Check http://ilps.science.uva.nl/resources/ssscrape


Requirements
============

 - Python 2.4 or higher
 - Apache/PHP (for web monitor)

Installing Ssscrape
===================

 - Installing 3rd-party libraries into Ssscrape/lib/ext directory.
   The following libraries have to be installed:
    * BeautifulSoup (for HTML parsing): http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
    * Universal feed parser (for RSS/Atom feed parsing): http://feedparser.org/
    * anewt (for web interface for monitor): https://launchpad.net/anewt
      Ssscrape has been made with anewt revision 1279 of 2008.08.29
    * chardet (Universal encoding detector): http://chardet.feedparser.org/
    * twisted (for parallelizing database access): http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/
    * zope.interface is needed by twisted

 - Adjusting config file.
   Copy conf/local.conf.sample to conf/local.conf and adjust parameters for your setup.
   The most important parameters are MySQL database credentials. In the current 
   implementation both database should reside on one host and share the same username
   and password. Do not change the names of the databases in local.conf.

 - Creating database tables.
   Ssscrape uses two databases: 'ssscrapecontrol' (defined in the [database] section
   of the config file) and 'ssscrape' (defined in the [database-workers] section).
   To initialize tables in these databases:
    * Execute SQL statements in Ssscrape/database/database-schema-control.sql for the
      'ssscrapecontrol' database;
    * Execute SQL statements in Ssscrape/database/database-schema-feeds.sql for the
      'ssscrape' database.

 - Configuring web server (Apache)
   Set up your web server so that Ssscrape's monitor is accessible through a browser. 
   For example, the following should be added to the Apache config file:

    # PHP
    PHPIniDir /PATH/TO/DIR/CONTAINING/php.ini
    LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </FilesMatch>

    DirectoryIndex index.php

    Alias /ssscrape /PATH/TO/SSSCRAPE/web
    <Directory "/PATH/TO/SSSCRAPE/web/monitor">
        Options All
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "Password Required"
        AuthUserFile /PATH/TO/SSSCRAPE/web/.htpasswd
        Require valid-user
    </Directory>

   Regarding the php.ini file, it may be necessary to turn off warnings and errors, to 
   prevent interference with the ssscrape monitor.

   You should setup /PATH/TO/SSSCRAPE/web/.htaccess and /PATH/TO/SSSCRAPE/web/.htpasswd  
   so that access to Ssscrape monitor is protected.

   Check that the monitor is accessible via a browser.


Starting Ssscrape daemons
=========================

Run the following command to start Ssscrape scheduler:

  $ ./bin/ssscrape-keep-alive scheduler

Run the following command to start Ssscrape monitor:

  $ ./bin/ssscrape-keep-alive 

Check the log files in the Ssscrape/log directory for possible errors.

Multiple monitors can be started on multiple hosts, if they are configured identically.

You may want to add the two commands above to your crontab, so that it checks regularly
and restarts processes if they, for some reason, crash.


Adding new feeds to Ssscrape
============================

Run the script bin/ssscrape-add-feed from the root directory of a (properly 
configured) Ssscrape installation. Use -h to get an overview of options.
Alternatively, use "Create new feed" link on the "Feeds" tab in the monitor.

Check the status of your feeds via web monitor (e.g., by specifying one of 
the tags assigned when adding the feeds).

If the scheduler and the manager(s) are running, you will see the data collected
from your feeds in the monitor. You can also access the data directly from 
the database (check out SQL queries at the bottom of monitor's pages).
